Eboost Core 0.14.2
=====================

Setup
---------------------
Eboost Core is the original Eboost client and it builds the backbone of the network. However, it downloads and stores the entire history of Eboost transactions (which is currently several GBs); depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run Eboost on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- `bin/eboost-qt` (GUI) or
- `bin/eboostd` (headless)

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run eboost-qt.exe.

### OS X

Drag Eboost-Core to your applications folder, and then run Eboost-Core.
